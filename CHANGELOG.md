# Changelog

All notable changes to the Home Assistant Entity Visualizer will be documented in this file.

## [0.8.18] - 2025-10-08

### Major Improvement
- **üîß Template Compiler Integration**: Now uses Home Assistant's built-in template compiler for dependency detection
- **‚ú® More Reliable**: Uses `Template.async_render_to_info()` - the same method Developer Tools uses
- **üìä Better Coverage**: Handles complex templates with multi-line syntax, nested structures, all Jinja2 features

### Enhanced Template Detection
- **Template Select Entities**: Now correctly detects dependencies in template select helpers (Issue #15)
- **All Template Types**: Improved detection for sensors, binary sensors, switches, buttons, numbers, text
- **Automation Templates**: Better handling of template conditions in automations and scripts
- **Complex Templates**: Reliably parses templates that regex patterns would miss

### Technical
- Added `_extract_template_entities_using_ha()` using `Template.async_render_to_info()`
- Updated all template parsing to use HA's compiler instead of regex
- Graceful fallback to regex parsing if template compilation fails
- Template dependency detection now stays in sync with HA's capabilities

- **üîÑ Setup Logic Improvement**: Made panel registration more robust to handle edge cases during HA restarts
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental**: This is an attempted fix based on code analysis - unable to reproduce the issue locally

### Technical
- Added `_ensure_panel_registered()` function to retry panel registration in edge case scenarios
- Modified setup logic to always verify panel registration even when services are already initialized
- Enhanced error handling and logging around panel registration
- **Note**: If issue persists, we need more detailed reproduction steps and log files

## [0.8.11] - 2025-09-02

### Added
- **üîÑ Persistent User Preferences**: Show Areas, Depth, and Layout settings now remembered between sessions
- **üíæ Client-Side Storage**: All preferences stored locally using browser localStorage - completely private

### Enhanced
- **üéØ Smart Defaults**: Preferences gracefully fall back to sensible defaults when localStorage unavailable

### Technical
- Added `loadUserPreferences()`, `saveUserPreferences()`, and `applyUserPreferences()` methods
- Implemented localStorage-based preference management with validation and sanitization
