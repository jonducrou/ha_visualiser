# Technical Decisions & Known Issues

This document tracks technical approaches that have been attempted, what works, what doesn't, and why. This prevents repeating failed approaches and provides context for future development decisions.

## Testing Infrastructure

### What Works ✅
- **Code Syntax Validation**: `python3 tests/validate_code.py` - Reliable for basic syntax checking
- **File Serving Tests**: `bash tests/test_file_serving.sh` - Basic file existence and structure validation
- **Manual Testing**: Testing in actual HA development environment provides the most reliable results

### What Doesn't Work ❌
- **pytest in CI/Development Environment**: 
  - **Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pytest'` and `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'custom_components'`
  - **Root Cause**: 
    1. Missing pytest installation (`pip install pytest` not run)
    2. Missing Home Assistant core dependencies (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'homeassistant'`)
    3. Integration imports HA modules (`from homeassistant.config_entries import ConfigEntry`) which aren't available outside HA
  - **Attempted Solutions**: 
    - Direct pytest execution: FAILED - missing pytest dependency
    - test_runner.py with fallback logic: FAILED - still tries to import HA modules
    - Adding current directory to Python path: FAILED - HA dependencies still missing
  - **Decision**: Current test infrastructure requires Home Assistant environment. For development, use syntax validation only.

### Test Strategy That Works ✅
1. **Mock-Based Unit Testing**: Use `run_pytest_suite.py` for comprehensive business logic testing (NEW)
2. **Syntax Validation**: Use `validate_code.py` for Python syntax checking
3. **File Structure**: Use `test_file_serving.sh` for basic file checks  
4. **Integration Testing**: Copy to HA `custom_components/` and test in live environment
5. **Manual Verification**: Use HA developer tools and logs for debugging

### Recommended Development Testing Workflow ✅
```bash
# 1. PREFERRED: Complete mock-based testing (NEW - v0.8.11+)
python3 tests/run_pytest_suite.py

# 2. Legacy: Syntax validation only (for quick checks)
python3 tests/validate_code.py

# 2. Basic file structure check  
bash tests/test_file_serving.sh

# 3. Manual integration testing
# - Copy files to HA custom_components/ha_visualiser/
# - Restart Home Assistant
# - Check logs for errors
# - Test frontend panel functionality
# - Verify bug fixes with actual HA entities
```

### Why Current pytest Approach Fails ❌
The existing `tests/test_runner.py` and `tests/test_graph_service.py` assume a full Home Assistant environment with:
- Home Assistant core installed (`homeassistant` module)
- Entity/device/area registries available
- WebSocket infrastructure running
- Full HA state management

**To Fix This Would Require**:
- Complex HA environment mocking (high maintenance overhead)
- Installing HA core as development dependency (heavyweight)
- Rewriting tests to avoid HA imports (significant effort)

**Current Decision**: Development environment testing focuses on syntax validation. Comprehensive testing happens in actual HA environment.

## HACS Submission

### What Works ✅
- **Repository Structure**: HACS-compliant structure with proper manifest.json
- **GitHub Actions**: Both HACS and hassfest validation actions pass
- **Release Strategy**: Tagged releases with proper versioning
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with examples and features

### What Doesn't Work ❌
- **Auto-submission**: HACS PRs get auto-rejected for unknown reasons
- **Previous Attempts**: 
  - PR #4007: Auto-rejected immediately
  - **Likely Causes**: Unknown, possibly too many recent submissions or missing requirements

### Current Approach ✅
- **Manual PR Preparation**: Create branch and PR content without auto-submitting
- **Review First**: Allow manual review of PR content before submission
- **HACS_PR_DRAFT.md**: Template with proper HACS formatting and requirements

## Bug Fix Strategy

### What Works ✅
- **Device Trigger Issues**: Fixed by modifying `_extract_entities_from_config()` to use device nodes instead of all device entities
- **Group Helper Detection**: Enhanced with comprehensive attribute checking and debug logging
- **GitHub Issue Management**: Close issues with detailed technical explanations
- **Version Management**: Semantic versioning with clear changelog documentation

### Development Workflow That Works ✅
1. **Issue Investigation**: Read code, understand problem scope
2. **Targeted Fixes**: Modify specific functions rather than broad refactoring  
3. **Testing**: Use syntax validation + manual HA testing
4. **Documentation**: Update README, plan.md, and commit messages with details
5. **Version Bump**: Increment version and create tagged release
6. **Issue Closure**: Close GitHub issues with technical explanation

## Code Architecture

### What Works ✅
- **GraphService**: Centralized entity relationship detection
- **WebSocket API**: Real-time communication with frontend
- **Modular Relationship Detection**: Separate methods for different relationship types
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and graceful failures

### What Doesn't Work ❌
- **Complex Refactoring**: Large-scale changes often introduce new issues
- **Over-engineering**: Simple, targeted fixes work better than complex solutions

## Dependencies & Environment

### What Works ✅
- **Home Assistant Native APIs**: Using `hass.states`, `hass.config_entries`, etc.
- **Standard Library**: Using built-in Python modules when possible
- **Minimal External Dependencies**: Keep requirements.txt minimal

### What Doesn't Work ❌
- **Heavy External Libraries**: Avoid complex dependencies that may conflict with HA
- **Development Environment Testing**: Testing outside HA environment has limited value

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Keep It Simple**: Targeted fixes work better than comprehensive refactoring
2. **Test in HA Environment**: Manual testing in actual HA is more reliable than unit tests
3. **Document Everything**: Clear commit messages and issue explanations prevent confusion
4. **Version Management**: Always bump version after significant changes
5. **HACS Process**: Manual review and submission works better than auto-submission

## Critical Boot Failure Lessons (v0.8.8-0.8.9)

### Home Assistant Integration Safety ❌→✅
- **Issue**: v0.8.8 aggressive auto-initialization caused HA boot failures for users
- **Impact**: **CRITICAL** - Users' Home Assistant installations failed to start
- **Root Cause**: Removed safety checks without considering initialization conflicts and error cases
- **Lesson**: **NEVER break users' HA installations** - integration failures must be non-fatal to HA startup

### Initialization Safety Patterns ❌→✅
- **Problem**: Forced initialization without duplicate detection or error handling
- **Consequence**: Conflicts between YAML and config entry setup paths, partial initialization states
- **Solution**: Always check for existing initialization, comprehensive error handling with cleanup
- **Pattern**: `if DOMAIN in hass.data: return True` prevents conflicts

### Critical Hotfix Process ✅
1. **Immediate User Support**: Provide recovery instructions (CLI removal) before fixing
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify exact failure points in initialization logic
3. **Conservative Fix**: Restore safety while preserving intended functionality
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Syntax validation and logical flow analysis
5. **Emergency Release**: Same-day hotfix with clear communication

### Error Handling Best Practices ✅
```python
try:
    return await _setup_integration(hass, config)
except Exception as e:
    _LOGGER.error("Failed to setup integration: %s", e, exc_info=True)
    # CRITICAL: Clean up on failure to prevent partial initialization
    if DOMAIN in hass.data:
        hass.data.pop(DOMAIN)
    return False
```

## Major Architectural Lessons (v0.8.7-0.8.8)

### Early Return Bug Pattern ❌
- **Issue**: Special node types (device, area, zone, label, scene) returned early, never reaching automation relationship checking
- **Impact**: Caused bidirectional relationship bugs (issue #5)
- **Root Cause**: Each special node handler had its own early return without calling shared relationship methods
- **Lesson**: When adding new node types, ensure they don't skip universal relationship checks

### Config Flow vs Auto-Setup ❌→✅
- **Original Approach**: Required manual integration setup via Settings > Integrations
- **Problem**: Users expected automatic setup after file installation (issues #8, #9)
- **Solution**: Removed `config_flow: true`, made `async_setup()` always initialize
- **Lesson**: For simple integrations, auto-setup provides better user experience than config flows

### Relationship Detection Architecture ✅
- **What Works**: Having universal relationship methods that can be called from anywhere
- **What Doesn't Work**: Node-specific handlers that bypass universal checks
- **Pattern**: All node types should call automation/script/scene relationship methods before returning

### Bug Investigation Methodology ✅
1. **Read GitHub Issue Carefully**: Issue #5 was reopened - our fix didn't actually work
2. **Trace Code Flow**: Found that device nodes returned early, never reaching automation code
3. **Fix Root Cause**: Add relationship checks to ALL special node handlers, not just regular entities
4. **Verify Fix**: Ensure the architectural problem is solved, not just the symptom

## Error Handling and Data Validation Lessons (v0.8.10)

### Graph Service Data Integrity ❌→✅
- **Issue**: "'NoneType' object is not iterable" errors when graph service returned None for nodes/edges (Issue #10)
- **Root Cause**: Graph building methods could fail silently without proper error handling, returning corrupted data structures
- **Lesson**: **Always validate data structures before returning from service methods** - never assume success

### WebSocket API Defensive Programming ❌→✅
- **Problem**: WebSocket handlers assumed graph service would always return valid list structures
- **Consequence**: Frontend crashes when attempting to iterate over None values from backend failures
- **Solution**: Add validation and safe fallbacks at API boundary between services and frontend
- **Pattern**: `if nodes is None: nodes = []` prevents downstream crashes

### Comprehensive Error Recovery ✅
```python
try:
    # Complex graph building logic
    return {"nodes": nodes_list, "edges": edges_list}
except Exception as e:
    _LOGGER.error(f"Error building graph: {e}", exc_info=True)
    # Return safe empty result instead of corrupted data
    return {"nodes": [], "edges": [], "center_node": entity_id}
```

### Data Structure Validation Best Practices ✅
- Always validate data types before returning from service methods
- Use isinstance() checks for type safety: `isinstance(nodes, dict)`
- Provide safe fallbacks for all data structures
- Log detailed error information to help identify root causes

## Mock-Based Unit Testing Success (v0.8.11+)

### What Now Works ✅
- **Comprehensive Business Logic Testing**: 47 unit tests covering core functionality
- **Mocked HA Dependencies**: Tests run without requiring Home Assistant installation
- **Fast Feedback**: Complete test suite runs in under 1 second
- **High Coverage**: Preference management, graph service, WebSocket API all tested

### Implementation Approach That Succeeded ✅
```python
# Mock Home Assistant modules before importing our code
sys.modules['homeassistant.core'] = mock_hass_core
sys.modules['homeassistant.helpers.entity_registry'] = mock_entity_registry
# ... etc

# Then import and test our business logic
from custom_components.ha_visualiser.graph_service import GraphService
```

### Test Categories Added ✅
1. **Preference Management (14 tests)**: localStorage logic, parsing, validation, error handling
2. **Graph Service Logic (23 tests)**: Data structures, entity patterns, relationship types  
3. **WebSocket API (10 tests)**: Command validation, error handling, response formatting

### Benefits Achieved ✅
- **Early Bug Detection**: Catch logic errors before GitHub issues
- **Regression Prevention**: Tests validate fixes stay fixed
- **Development Speed**: Fast iteration without HA environment setup
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable specifications

## Panel Registration Debugging (v0.8.12)

### Issue Investigation ❓→🔧
- **Problem**: Multiple users reporting sidebar panel not appearing after installation (Issue #11)
- **Challenge**: Unable to reproduce issue locally - working correctly in development environment
- **Approach**: Code analysis to identify potential edge cases in panel registration

### Suspected Root Cause ❓
Based on code analysis, identified potential issue with early return logic:
1. `async_setup()` has early return if `DOMAIN in hass.data` (line 35-37)
2. `_setup_integration()` has early return if `"graph_service" in hass.data[DOMAIN]` (line 61-63)
3. **Edge Case**: If integration partially initializes (sets hass.data but panel registration fails), subsequent restarts would skip panel registration entirely

### Experimental Fix Applied 🔧
```python
# Before: Early return skipped panel registration
if "graph_service" in hass.data[DOMAIN]:
    return True

# After: Always ensure panel is registered
if "graph_service" in hass.data[DOMAIN]:
    return await _ensure_panel_registered(hass)
```

### Key Changes ✅
- Added `_ensure_panel_registered()` function for reliable panel registration
- Modified setup logic to always verify panel registration even when services exist
- Enhanced error handling and logging around panel registration
- Refactored to eliminate code duplication

### Debugging Strategy for Non-Reproducible Issues ✅
1. **Code Analysis**: Identify potential edge cases based on user reports
2. **Defensive Programming**: Make code more robust against edge cases
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Add detailed logging to help identify issues
4. **User Feedback Loop**: Release experimental fix and gather detailed feedback
5. **Iterative Improvement**: Use user logs to identify actual root cause if fix doesn't work

## Panel Registration Root Cause Resolution (v0.8.13)

### Issue #11 - Root Cause Identified and Fixed ✅
- **Problem**: Multiple users reported sidebar panel not appearing after installation
- **Root Cause Discovered**: Integration had `"config_flow": false` which prevented Home Assistant from calling initialization code for users without YAML configuration
- **Impact**: Most users experienced complete integration failure (not just panel issues)

### Solution That Works ✅
1. **Enable Config Flow**: Changed `"config_flow": true` in manifest.json
2. **User-Friendly Setup**: Added rich config flow with clear feature descriptions and setup guidance
3. **Standard HA Pattern**: Uses config entries for reliable initialization (the proper Home Assistant way)
4. **Backward Compatibility**: YAML configurations automatically imported to config entries

### Config Flow Best Practices ✅
```python
# User-friendly setup flow
return self.async_show_form(
    step_id="user",
    data_schema=vol.Schema({}),  # No complex config needed
    description_placeholders={
        "description": (
            "**Entity Visualizer** adds an interactive graph panel...\n\n"
            "**What you'll get:**\n"
            "• **Interactive Entity Graph** - Visualize entities and relationships\n"
            "• **Smart Search** - Find any entity\n"
            # ... detailed feature list
            "*No configuration needed - just click Submit to install.*"
        )
    },
)
```

### User Experience Improvements ✅
- **Clear Setup Instructions**: Users guided through Settings → Integrations → Add Integration → Entity Visualizer
- **Rich Feature Description**: Detailed explanation of what they get and how to use it
- **Success Confirmation**: Clear messages confirming successful setup
- **Enhanced Diagnostics**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### Technical Implementation ✅
- **Dual Setup Support**: Handles both config entries and YAML imports
- **File Validation**: Checks for missing frontend files before panel registration
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better diagnostics and cleanup on failures
- **Setup Confirmation**: Visual indicators (✅/❌) in logs for each step

## Template Dependency Detection (v0.8.18-0.8.19)

### Problem: Regex Template Parsing Limitations ❌
- **Issue**: Complex templates with multi-line syntax, nested structures not reliably parsed by regex
- **Example**: Template select entities (Issue #15) showed dependencies in Dev Tools but not in visualizer
- **Root Cause**: Custom regex patterns can't handle all Jinja2 template variations

### Solution: Use HA's Template Compiler ✅
**Approach**: Use `Template.async_render_to_info()` - the exact method Developer Tools uses

```python
from homeassistant.helpers.template import Template

def _extract_template_entities_using_ha(self, template_str: str) -> Set[str]:
    template = Template(template_str, self.hass)
    render_info = template.async_render_to_info()
    return render_info.entities  # Set[str] of entity IDs
```

### Why This Works ✅
1. **Same as Dev Tools**: Uses identical method to what users see in Developer Tools
2. **HA Does Parsing**: Relies entirely on Home Assistant's template engine, not custom logic
3. **Handles All Jinja2**: Works with multi-line, nested, complex templates automatically
4. **Always In Sync**: Uses HA instance's parser, so it stays current with HA updates
5. **Graceful Fallback**: Falls back to regex if template compilation fails

### What's Now Covered ✅
- Template helpers (select, sensor, binary_sensor, switch, button, number, text)
- All template fields: `state`, `options`, `select_option`, `value_template`, etc.
- Automation/script template conditions
- **NEW (v0.8.19)**: Automation template triggers with `value_template`
- Template reference checking throughout codebase

### Implementation Details ✅
- Updated `_find_template_config_relationships()` to use compiler
- Updated `_extract_entities_from_conditions()` to use compiler
- Updated `_extract_entities_from_condition_config()` to use compiler
- Updated `_entity_referenced_in_template_string()` to use compiler
- **NEW (v0.8.19)**: Updated `_extract_entities_from_config()` to handle template triggers
- **NEW (v0.8.19)**: Updated `_entity_referenced_in_config()` for reverse template relationships
- Kept `_extract_entities_from_template_string_advanced()` as fallback

### Missing Template Support Fixed (v0.8.19) ✅
**Problem**: Template triggers in automations weren't showing entity dependencies
- **Issue**: Automation template triggers (platform: template) with `value_template` not extracted
- **Impact**: Forward relationships (automation → entity) missing
- **Impact**: Reverse relationships (entity → automation) missing
- **Root Cause**: `_extract_entities_from_config()` only checked direct entity_id, not templates
- **Root Cause**: `_entity_referenced_in_config()` didn't check template fields for reverse relationships

**Solution**: Added template compiler checks to both functions
```python
# In _extract_entities_from_config (forward relationships)
value_template = config.get("value_template")
if value_template:
    template_entities = self._extract_template_entities_using_ha(value_template)
    entities.update(template_entities)

# In _entity_referenced_in_config (reverse relationships)
value_template = config.get("value_template")
if value_template and self._entity_referenced_in_template_string(entity_id, value_template):
    return True
```

## NoneType Iteration Error Fix (v0.8.20)

### Problem: Null Attribute Values Causing Graph Failures ❌
- **Issue**: "NoneType object is not iterable" error when building neighbourhood graphs (Issue #18)
- **Root Cause**: `dict.get("key", [])` returns `None` when key exists but value is `None`, not the default `[]`
- **Affected Code**: Multiple places in `_find_group_relationships()` called `.extend()` on potentially `None` values
- **Impact**: Graph building failed completely for any entity, showing empty graph

### Solution: Use `or []` Pattern ✅
**Before** (fails when attribute is `None`):
```python
players_attr = group_state.attributes.get("group_members", [])
member_entities.extend(players_attr)  # TypeError if players_attr is None
```

**After** (handles both missing and `None` values):
```python
players_attr = group_state.attributes.get("group_members") or []
member_entities.extend(players_attr)  # Always safe
```

### Files Fixed ✅
- `graph_service.py`: Updated ~50 occurrences of `.get("attr", [])` pattern to `.get("attr") or []`
- Sections fixed:
  - `search_entities()` - group member extraction
  - `_find_group_relationships()` - all group type handlers (light, switch, cover, fan, media_player, climate)
  - Reverse relationship detection in Part 2

### Key Lesson ✅
In Home Assistant, entity attributes can have explicit `None` values (e.g., `group_members: null`).
The `.get(key, default)` pattern only returns `default` when key is missing, not when value is `None`.
Always use `or []` to handle both cases safely when the result will be iterated.

## Current Status (v0.8.20)

- ✅ **Testing**: Mock-based unit testing (50/50 tests passing) + syntax validation + manual HA testing
- ✅ **Bug Fixes**: All major architectural issues resolved (bidirectional relationships, auto-setup, graph data corruption)
- ✅ **Critical Safety**: Boot failure and data corruption issues resolved with comprehensive error handling
- ✅ **User Experience**: Standard config flow setup with clear instructions, reliable panel registration
- ✅ **Panel Registration**: Root cause identified and fixed - config flow enables proper initialization (Issue #11 resolved)
- ✅ **Architecture**: Universal relationship checking + safe initialization + defensive data validation patterns
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks and data validation throughout service layer
- ✅ **Modern Integration Pattern**: Proper config flow implementation following Home Assistant best practices
- ✅ **Template Detection**: Uses HA's built-in template compiler for reliable dependency detection (Issue #15)
- ✅ **Template Triggers**: Automation template triggers now show entity dependencies (forward & reverse relationships)
- ✅ **Null Safety**: Fixed NoneType iteration errors when group attributes are null (Issue #18)

## Future Considerations

- **Testing**: Consider pytest setup with proper HA environment mocking (low priority)
- **HACS**: Monitor submission requirements for any changes
- **Architecture**: Current modular approach works well, avoid major refactoring
- **Performance**: Only optimize if specific performance issues reported by users
